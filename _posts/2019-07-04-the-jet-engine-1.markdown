> # 0 Introduction
> This book has been written to provide a simple and self-contained description of the working and underlying principles of the aero gas turbine engine. The use of complex formulae and the language of the specialist have been avoided to allow for a clear and concise presentation of the essential facts. Only such description and formulae, therefore, as are necessary to the understanding of the function and the theory of the engine are included.
> It will be noted that the emphasis in this book is on the turbo-jet engine and that no special part deals with the propeller-turbine engine. This is because the working principles of both engine types are essentially the same. However where differences in function or application do exist, these are described. The aero gas turbine is being continually developed to provide improved performance for each new generation of aircraft; the fourth edition of this book has been revised and expanded to include the latest aero gas engine technology.

# 前言

编写本书的目的是为航空燃气涡轮发动机的工作原理和基本原理提供简单而独立的描述。 避免使用复杂的公式和专家的语言，以便清楚，简洁地介绍基本事实。 因此，仅包括对理解发动机的功能和理论所必需的这种描述和公式。

值得注意的是，本书的重点是涡轮喷气发动机，没有特殊部件涉及螺旋桨涡轮发动机。 这是因为两种发动机类型的工作原理基本相同。 然而，在存在功能或应用的差异的情况下，描述了这些。 航空燃气轮机正在不断发展，以便为每一代新一代飞机提供更好的性能; 本书的第四版已经过修订和扩展，包括最新的航空燃气发动机技术。

### INTRODUCTION 
1.	The development of the gas turbine engine as an aircraft power plant has been so rapid that it is difficult to appreciate that prior to the 1950s very few people had heard of this method of aircraft propulsion. The possibility of using a reaction jet had interested aircraft designers for a long time, but initially the low speeds of early aircraft and the unsuitably of a piston engine for producing the large high velocity airflow necessary for the jet presented many obstacles.
2.	A French engineer, René Lorin, patented a jet propulsion engine (fig. 1-1) in 1913, but this was an athodyd (para. 11) and was at that period impossible to manufacture or use, since suitable heat resisting materials had not then been developed and, in the second place, jet propulsion would have been extremely inefficient at the low speeds of the aircraft of those days. However, today the modern ram jet is very similar to Lorin's conception.
3.	In 1930 Frank Whittle was granted his first patent for using a gas turbine to produce a propulsive jet,but it was eleven years before his engine completed its first flight. The Whittle engine formed the basis of the modern gas turbine engine, and from it was developed the Rolls-Royce Welland, Derwent, Nene and Dart engines. The Derwent and Nene turbo-jet engines had world-wide military applications; the Dart turbo-propeller engine became world famous as the power plant for the Vickers Viscount aircraft. Although other aircraft may be fitted; with later engines termed twin-spool, triple-spool, by-pass, ducted fan, unducted fan and propfan, these are inevitable developments of Whittle's early engine.
4.	The jet engine (fig. 1-2), although appearing so different from the piston engine-propeller combination, applies the same basic principles to effect propulsion. As shown in fig. 1-3, both propel their aircraft solely by thrusting a large weight of air backwards.
5.	Although today jet propulsion is popularly linked with the gas turbine engine, there are other types of jet propelled engines, such as the ram jet, the pulse jet, the rocket, the turbo/ram jet, and the turbo-rocket.

### 引言
1. 燃气涡轮发动机作为飞机动力装置的发展如此之快，以至于很难理解在20世纪50年代以前很少有人听说过这种飞机推进方法。很长一段时间以来，使用反作用射流的可能性引起了飞机设计者的兴趣，但早期飞机的飞行速度低和活塞发动机不适于产生射流所需的大量的高速气流，这带来了许多障碍。
2. 法国工程师勒内·洛林(René Lorin)在1913年申请了喷气推进发动机的专利(图1-1)，但这是一个冲压发动机(本文第11段提及)，在那个时期不可能制造或使用，因为当时还没有开发出合适的耐热材料，其次，在当时的飞机低速下，喷气推进效率极低。然而，今天的现代冲压喷气发动机与洛林的概念非常相似。
3. 1930年，弗兰克·惠特尔获得了他第一个使用燃气轮机产生推进力的喷气式飞机的专利，但是他的发动机完成第一次飞行已经十一年了。惠特尔发动机构成了现代燃气涡轮发动机的基础，并由此发展出罗尔斯·罗伊斯·韦兰发动机、德温特发动机、内内发动机和达特发动机。德温特和内内涡轮喷气发动机在世界军事范围内广泛应用；达特涡轮螺旋桨发动机作为维克斯子爵飞机的动力装置而闻名于世。同样也可以安装与其他飞机；后来的发动机被称为发动机、三转子发动机、双涵道发动机、涵道风扇发动机、涵道风扇发动机和桨扇发动机，这些发动机都是惠特尔早期发动机的必然发展。
4. 喷气发动机(图1-2)虽然看起来与活塞式发动机-螺旋桨组合有很大不同，但实现推进的基本原理是相同的。如图1-3所示，两者都通过向后推动（喷射）大量的空气来推进飞机。
5. 虽然今天喷气推进普遍与燃气涡轮发动机相联系，但也有其他类型的喷气推进发动机，如冲压喷气发动机、脉冲喷气发动机、火箭发动机、涡轮/冲压喷气发动机和涡轮火箭发动机。
