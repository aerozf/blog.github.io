> # Introduction

> This book has been written to provide a simple and self-contained description of the working and underlying principles of the aero gas turbine engine. The use of complex formulae and the language of the specialist have been avoided to allow for a clear and concise presentation of the essential facts. Only such description and formulae, therefore, as are necessary to the understanding of the function and the theory of the engine are included.

> It will be noted that the emphasis in this book is on the turbo-jet engine and that no special part deals with the propeller-turbine engine. This is because the working principles of both engine types are essentially the same. However where differences in function or application do exist, these are described. The aero gas turbine is being continually developed to provide improved performance for each new generation of aircraft; the fourth edition of this book has been revised and expanded to include the latest aero gas engine technology.

# 引言

编写本书的目的是为航空燃气涡轮发动机的工作原理和基本原理提供简单而独立的描述。 避免使用复杂的公式和专家的语言，以便清楚，简洁地介绍基本事实。 因此，仅包括对理解发动机的功能和理论所必需的这种描述和公式。

值得注意的是，本书的重点是涡轮喷气发动机，没有特殊部件涉及螺旋桨涡轮发动机。 这是因为两种发动机类型的工作原理基本相同。 然而，在存在功能或应用的差异的情况下，描述了这些。 航空燃气轮机正在不断发展，以便为每一代新一代飞机提供更好的性能; 本书的第四版已经过修订和扩展，包括最新的航空燃气发动机技术。
